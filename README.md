### This is a Parcel 1 plugin. 
### Parcel 2 has built-in support for compressing assets: https://parceljs.org/features/production/#compression

------

Parcel 1 plugin that precompresses all assets in production mode. 

This plugin utilizes [@gfx/zopfli](https://github.com/gfx/universal-zopfli-js), [node-zopfli-es](https://github.com/jaeh/node-zopfli-es) and [zlib](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v13.x/docs/api/zlib.html) for GZip compression
and [zlib](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v13.x/docs/api/zlib.html) (Node 11.7.0+) and [brotli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brotli) for Brotli compression.


## Installation

```
npm install parcel-plugin-compress -D
```


## Usage

By default, this plugin doesn't require any extra configuration to get started. If, however, you'd like to be more targeted in how this plugin is applied, you can configure the plugin as needed.

To configure, add a file called `.compressrc` in your project's root folder, or add a key in your `package.json` called `compress`. The available options are below, with the defaults.

```js
{
  // a regular expression to test filenames against
  "test": ".",
  // a number that represents the minimum filesize to compress, in bytes
  "threshold": undefined,
  // Concurrency limit for p-queue
  concurrency: 2,
  // configuration options for gzip compression
  "gzip": {
    "enabled": true,
    "numiterations": 15,
    "blocksplitting": true,
    "blocksplittinglast": false,
    "blocksplittingmax": 15,
    // use zlib instead of zopfli if zlib is true
    "zlib": false,
    "zlibLevel": 9,
    "zlibMemLevel": 9
  },
  // configuration options for brotli compress
  "brotli": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": 0, // 0 = generic, 1 = text, 2 = font (used in WOFF 2.0)
    "quality": 11, // 0 - 11, 11 = best
    "lgwin": 24, // 10 - 24    
    "enable_context_modeling": true, // disabling decreases compression ratio in favour of decompression speed
    "lgblock": undefined, // 16 - 24
    "nPostfix": undefined, // 0 - 3
    "nDirect": undefined // 0 to (15 << nPostfix) in steps of (1 << nPostfix)
  },
  // a flag that changes the behavior of the plugin, by default this option is disabled
  // and the plugin compresses all the files it receives via the Parcel bundle object
  // and match the test regular expression
  //	
  // if true the plugin compresses all files in the output directory and subdirectories
  // that match the test regular expression
  compressOutput: false
}
```


## Browser Support for Brotli

Current versions of the major browsers send `br` in the `Accept-Encoding` header when the request is sent over TLS

Support introduced in version ...

  * Edge 15
  * Firefox 44
  * Chrome 50
  * Safari 11


## Server support

To take advantage of precompressed resources you need a server that is able to understand the `Accept-Encoding` header and serve files ending with `.gz` and `.br` accordingly.

#### Nginx 
Nginx supports Gzip compressed files out of the box with the `gzip_static` directive. 

Add this to a `http`, `server` or `location` section and Nginx will automatically search for files ending with .gz when the request contains an `Accept-Encoding` header with the value `gzip`. 
```
gzip_static  on;  
```
See the [documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html) for more information.

To enable Brotli support you either 
  * build the [ngx_brotli](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli) from source:          
    https://www.majlovesreg.one/adding-brotli-to-a-built-nginx-instance
  * or install a pre-built Nginx from ppa with the brotli module included:  
    https://gablaxian.com/blog/brotli-compression
  * or use the approach described in this blog post that works without the brotli module:
